This is a github visulatison tool created using react that makes use of the Github API which can login a github user and retrieve the user's information such as their followers, following, number of private repositries, number of public repositries.

I used a login for this tool as it increases the rate limit from 60 requests per hour for none authenticated users to 5000 requests per hour for authenicated users. ALso by using a logged developer to access their data I am able to retrieve more sensitive information such as thier private repositries.

This application can return the user's most used language based on their repositries, display the language statistics in a piechart which was created using Nivo rocks and displays the user's commit history over the following year.
