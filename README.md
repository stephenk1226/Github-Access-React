This is a github visulatison tool created using react that makes use of the Github API which can login a github user and retrieve the user's information such as their followers, following, number of private repositries, number of public repositries.

This application can return the user's most used language based on their repositries, display the language statistics in a piechart which was created using Nivo rocks and displays the user's commit history over the following year.

I used a login for this tool as it increases the rate limit from 60 requests per hour for none authenticated users to 5000 requests per hour for authenicated users. ALso by using a logged developer to access their data I am able to retrieve more sensitive information such as thier private repositries.
